MScThesis
English Sign Language recognition system, based on Convolutional- Recurrent Neural Network through Deep Sequence Models for Î™mage Classification
The purpose of the project is to train the system resulting in the recognition of the word in videos where a human reproduces it in sign language.
For the success of the result, the image classification method was applied to several series of image (frames) of each video, and analyzing by Deep Sequence Models.
